# Hello Languages

This is my explorations in the most common languages. Simple to complex examples will be implemented parallelly on each language to outline its implementation of the intended funcitonalilty.

Follow it [here](https://bigsby.github.io/HelloLanguages).

The current list of languages is:
- JavaScript
- C++
- Python
- F#
- Go
- Ruby
- C#

To be included, one of these days:
- Rust
- Scala
- Haskell

The order of programs (functionalities) to implement is:
1. Hello, World! (of course)
2. Iterate a sequence
3. DRY
4. Receive input
